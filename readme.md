* **HR**:
ovaj projekt je prvobitno napravljen kao projektni zadatak za studentsku praksu tvrtke Favicode. Projekt je funkcionalan, no napravljen je proceduralno a trebao bi biti više objektno orijentiran i treba dodati AJAX za klijent-server stranu što bi rezultiralo dinamičnijom stranicom. Zadaća laboratorijskih vježbi kolegija WEB Programiranje na FERIT-u biti će implementacija spomenutog. Aplikacija je jednostavnija verzija web-servisa poput Google drivea, Dropboxa, Mege i sl. za prijenos i preuzimanje vlastitih datoteka na internet.
